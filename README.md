## Introduction

Welcome to the Data Science Playground! In this notebook, we'll explore some basic arithmetic operations and conversions, along with an overview of common tools and languages used in data science.

### Data Science Languages

- Python
- R
- SQL

### Data Science Libraries

- NumPy
- pandas
- Matplotlib
- scikit-learn

### Data Science Tools

| Tool        | Description                  |
|-------------|------------------------------|
| Jupyter     | Interactive computing        |
| TensorFlow  | Machine learning framework   |
| Tableau     | Data visualization tool      |

## Arithmetic Expressions

Let's explore some simple arithmetic operations.

```python
# Multiplication and addition
result = 2 * 3 + 4
print("Result:", result)

# Conversion: minutes to hours
minutes = 120
hours = minutes / 60
print("Hours:", hours)
```

## Objectives

1. Introduce basic arithmetic operations.
2. Demonstrate conversion between minutes and hours.
3. Provide an overview of common data science languages, libraries, and tools.
